# Sobio Budget Planner

A local-first personal budget app built with Streamlit and SQLite. Track income and spending by month, plan fixed expenses, set allocation objectives, and close out months once reconciled.

## Features
- Month-based budgeting with open/closed month lifecycle
- Fixed expenses that auto-apply when a month is initialized
- Budget objectives (fixed, variable, savings) as % of income
- Transaction entry with categories, subcategories, and payment method
- Monthly summaries and category rollups

## Tech stack
- Python 3.11+
- Streamlit UI
- SQLite database stored locally

## Quick start

### Option A: Makefile (recommended)
```
make setup
make run
```

### Option B: pip
```
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
python -m streamlit run src/budget_app/app/main.py
```

Then open the URL printed by Streamlit (usually http://localhost:8501).

## Data storage
- Database file: `db/budget.db` (created on first run)
- Schema: `src/budget_app/sql/schema.sql`

## Development
- Lint/format:
```
make lint
```

## Notes
- This app is local-first: all data stays in your `db/` folder.
- If you want a fresh start, delete `db/budget.db` and re-run the app.
